## Things I want to know more about

1.What is a component?
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

2.What are the charactistics of a component?
- Reusability 
  - Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different  applications However, some components may be designed for a specific task.  

- Replaceable 
  - Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- Not context specific
  - Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- Extensible 
  - A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- Encapsulated  
  -  A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- Independent  
  - Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.


3.What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
- Ease of deployment
  - As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- Reduced cost  
  - The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- Ease of development 
  - Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- Reusable 
  - The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- Modification of technical complexity
  - A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

- Reliability
  - The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- System maintenance and evolution 
  - Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

- Independent 
  - Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

  ## What is props short for?
“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.


## How are props used in React?
1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. Finally, render the Props Data

## What is the flow of props?
data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
